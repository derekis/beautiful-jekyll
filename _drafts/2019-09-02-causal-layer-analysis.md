Last Friday, I attended a course at the [Civil Service College](https://www.csc.gov.sg/) that introduced Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) as a technique for managing certain cognitive pitfalls in foresight work. As part of the learning activity, the class was challenged to apply CLA to a [promotional video for a holographic robot companion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkcKaNqfykg) launched in the Japanese market. Many in the class found working through the example to be eye-opening, and so I felt prompted to write this as a post-hoc reflection of the experience. 

# What is CLA? 

In CLA, the subject of analysis is considered on four levels, with its most obvious features represented at the tip of the iceberg.

- The layer above the waterline is referred to as the Litany. The Litany refers to the popularly known or official descriptions of a phenomenon. 
- In the layer just beneath the waterline, we group Systemic factors giving rise to the subject of interest. These could be social causes (including economic causes, political causes, etc.), or scientific causes. 
- The third layer is referred to as the Worldview, and would refer to discourses or ideologies that explain the 
- The bottom layer is for Metaphor & Myth. These are the archetypal patterns embedded at the level of culture and psychology that we almost unthinkingly rely on to apprehend a given phenomenon. 

Sohail Inayatullah, a Pakistani-Australian futures studies researcher, is credited for [developing CLA as a research method](http://www.cnid.cl/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/INAYATULLAH-Sohail.-Causal-layered-analysis.pdf). I see it as a development of a well-known analogy from the field of anthropology that [culture is like an iceberg](https://www.languageandculture.com/cultural-iceberg).

# CLA in Action

A disclaimer before I begin: for the purposes of this post, I am applying CLA as an amateur learning the method, and not as an expert in the method. In working through the example in class, however, I did also draw from prior knowledge of methods like [critical discourse analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_discourse_analysis).

## The Litany

The first step

An example of a common potential pitfall is confirmation bias, which describes the tendency to admit examples that support a hypothesis that one is presently invested in.
